Navigating the MONAI Toolkit
----------------------------

We recommend going sequentially through each chapter and focusing on the
specific types of tasks that youâ€™re interested in (e.g., Radiology,
Pathology, or Computer-Assisted Intervention).

For additional information on setting up your environment and using the
MONAI Toolkit, check out **Chapter 1: Getting Started**.

If you are at the start of your journey and looking to understand how to
speed up your image annotation process, check out **Chapter 2: Using
MONAI Label**.

If you already have an annotated dataset and want to get started
training with MONAI or integrate MONAI into your existing PyTorch
Training Loop, take a **Chapter 3: Using MONAI Core**.

If you are interested in MONAI and Federated Learning working together,
look at **Chapter 4: MONAI Federated Learning**.

If you are interested in some advanced topics and looking to compare
benchmarks, interested in performance profiling, or looking for some
researcher best practices with MONAI, check out **Chapter 5: Performance
and Benchmarking**.
