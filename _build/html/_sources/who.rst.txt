Who is this toolkit for?
##########################

************
Researcher
************

A Deep Learning Researcher’s role is to build novel domain-specific models and techniques to drive AI-powered acceleration for workflows or products. MONAI allows researchers to utilize standard building blocks to focus on creating their state-of-the-art AI models.

****************
Data Scientist
****************

A Data Scientist is a user/consumer of a research pipeline. The data scientist’s role is to adapt existing state-of-the-art domain techniques for specific data and use cases. They’ll refine and fine-tune the data science pipeline to fit the clinical workflow/application needed. MONAI aims to be easily integrated into existing pipelines, whether you
already have a PyTorch workflow or you’re just getting started on your task.

***********************
Application Developer
***********************

A platform developer aims to build a platform and service leveraging MONAI components that may include: - A labeling or active learning platform using MONAI Label - A complete ML platform for data scientists, integrated with data stores for data flow management with MONAI Label and Core.

**********
IT Admin
**********

An IT admin’s role is to provision and configure systems to stand up the MONAI Toolkit sandbox to serve an enterprise’s data science and research teams. The toolkit provides the perfect base for those teams to get started quickly with guided tutorials and validated workflows.
