MONAI Toolkit Overview
--------

NVIDIA co-founded Project `MONAI <https://monai.io/>`__, the Medical
Open Network for AI, with the world’s leading academic medical centers
to establish an inclusive community of AI researchers to develop and
exchange best practices for AI in healthcare imaging across academia and
enterprise researchers.

`MONAI <https://monai.io/>`__ is the domain-specific, open-source
Medical AI framework that drives research breakthroughs and accelerates
AI into clinical impact. MONAI unlocks the power of medical data to
build deep learning models for medical AI workflows. MONAI provides the
essential domain-specific tools from data labeling to model training,
making it easy to develop, reproduce and standardize medical AI
lifecycles.

**MONAI Enterprise** is NVIDIA’s offering for enterprise-grade use of
MONAI with an `NVIDIA AI Enterprise
(NVAIE) <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/>`__
3.0 license. MONAI Enterprise on NVAIE 3.0 offers the MONAI Toolkit
container, which provides enterprise developers and researchers with a
secure, scalable workflow to develop medical imaging AI.



**MONAI Toolkit** is a development sandbox offered as part of MONAI
Enterprise, an NVIDIA AI Enterprise-supported distribution of MONAI. It
includes a base container and a curated library of 9 pre-trained models
(CT, MR, Pathology, Endoscopy), available on
`NGC <https://ngc.nvidia.com/>`__, that allows data scientists and
clinical researchers to jumpstart AI development. The base container
includes the following:

-  MONAI Label: An intelligent labeling and learning tool with active
   learning that reduces data labeling costs by 75%
-  MONAI Core: A training framework to build robust AI models with
   self-supervised learning, federated learning, and Auto3D
   segmentation.

   -  With federated learning, APIs algorithms built with NVIDIA FLARE,
      MONAI can run on any federated learning platform.
   -  Auto3DSeg is domain-specialized AutoML for 3D segmentation,
      accelerating the development of medical imaging models and
      maximizing researcher productivity and throughput. Developers can
      get started with 1-5 lines of code, reducing training time from
      weeks/months to 2 days.

-  MONAI Model Zoo: A curated library of 9 pre-trained models (CT, MR,
   Pathology, Endoscopy) that allows data scientists and clinical
   researchers to jumpstart AI development
-  Curated Jupyter notebooks and tutorial resources to ease the
   onboarding process.
